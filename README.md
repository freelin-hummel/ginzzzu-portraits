# Ginzzzu's Portraits & NPC Dock

This Thilke fork keeps the upstream module ID and actor flags so it can replace
the existing installation without changing world data. The fork source and
release artifacts are published at:

https://github.com/freelin-hummel/ginzzzu-portraits

## Local review

From this repository:

```sh
npm test
npm run check
npm run foundry:review
```

The local review runner mounts this checkout into a Foundry 14 instance. Use
the direct port or the managed `ginzzzu-portraits-review.localhost` URL shown
by the runner.

## Deployment

The module can be deployed to the main, Lancer, and Troika Foundry data roots:

```sh
npm run deploy:main
npm run deploy:lancer
npm run deploy:troika
```

Restart the affected Foundry group after deployment so Foundry reloads the
module manifest and scripts.
A system-agnostic Foundry VTT module that brings a cinematic layer to your Foundry VTT games.
It displays character and NPC portraits directly on screen — much like a visual novel or dialogue-driven RPG. 

The module provides:

🎭 Dynamic portraits for PCs and NPCs with smooth animation transitions and emotions.

💬 NPC Dock, a visual panel bar for managing and displaying characters on screen that remembers sorting between worlds, supports folder-based sorting etc.

⚙️ Customizable layout, including sliders for portrait size, spacing, and screen offsets.

✨ Stylized UI with glass panels, glowing edges, and adaptive transparency.

💖 Direct portrait controls, including synchronized drag reorder, optional manual position, scale, tilt, and permission-aware access.

This module integrates seamlessly with other Foundry features and can be used both for roleplay storytelling and combat visualization for any gaming system.

## Installation
1. Copy https://github.com/freelin-hummel/ginzzzu-portraits/releases/latest/download/module.json
2. Paste it in your Foundry VTT, wait for install
3. Enable the module in your world
4. Enjoy!

# Usage
After installing, you’ll find a PC/NPC control panel at the bottom of your screen — an intuitive way to manage all your character portraits right on the tabletop.

## Panel controls
- **Left-click** — add or remove portraits on the screen.
- **Hold the configured panel modifier and left-click** — open the character sheet. Default: `Ctrl` / `Cmd`.
- **Right-click** — open the character sheet for any PC or NPC.
- **Middle-click** — add PCs or NPCs to **Favorites** to keep important characters at the front.
- **Drag** actor cards from the dock onto the canvas to create tokens.
- **Scroll** the mouse wheel to browse portraits.
- **Clear the screen** by pressing the `Clear All` button (red, top-right).
- **Toggle panel visibility** by pressing the `Show/Hide Panel` button (gray, top-right).
- **Folder selection**: use the folder dropdown to select an **actors** folder with portraits.
- **Quick search**: use `Search` field to filter portraits by name or folder path.

## Portrait controls
- **Middle-click a portrait** to highlight it and dim the others (adjustable in `Settings`).
- Move cursor over portrait to see character's name (can switch to permament visibility in settings).
- **Right-click to flip** portrait horizontally (players can flip their characters)
- **Hold the configured action modifier and left-click a portrait** to hide it. Default: `Ctrl` / `Cmd`.
- **Hold the configured action modifier and right-click a portrait** to open its actor sheet. Default: `Ctrl` / `Cmd`.
- **Drag a portrait** left or right to reorder active portraits on the screen. The shared order is synchronized through the scene and restored when the canvas loads.
- **Hold the configured keep-position key** when releasing a dragged portrait to keep its manual position, scale, and tilt instead of returning to the automatic layout. Default: `Shift`.
- **Use the mouse wheel while dragging** to scale the portrait.
- **Hold the configured transform key** while dragging to adjust scale and tilt without changing the reorder target. Default: `Alt`.

## Emotion panel
You can now assign expressive emotional states to any portrait. Check settings to switch on/off and allow players to use it.
Supported emotions include:
😊 Joy • 😢 Sadness • 😠 Anger • 😱 Fear • 💖 Love • 🤕 Hurt • 😪 Tired

Each emotion applies: color-grade filter, glowing highlight, a unique animated behavior (shake, tilt, bob, pulse, etc.).

How to use:
- Hover over a portrait to reveal the Emotion Panel
- Click an icon to apply an emotion
- Click the same icon again to remove it
- All connected users see the emotion and animation immediately

## Character settings
- Change displayed name in Player/NPC Sheet > Settings (3 dots in top right) > Configure Character Portrait.

## Useful tips
- Folder colors match each portrait’s background or outline for quick visual grouping.
- Filter player characters by placing them in different folders and choose certait folder in the module settings. Drag the actor into the selected folder so it will instantly appear in the dock — no reload required. 
- Use the `(Scene)` option to show portraits only for characters with tokens on the current scene.
- Dynamic lighting support: portraits dim with scene darkness for deeper immersion (adjustable in `Settings`).
- In `Settings`, use **Who can drag portraits**, **Animate portrait dragging**, and **Reset position on release** to tune the new portrait dragging behavior for your table.
- Use Foundry's **Configure Controls** menu to remap panel and portrait modifiers separately.
- Right-click an actor in the **Actors** list (top-right panel) and select **“Show portrait”**, or use the top-right button in the character sheet to instantly display the portrait.
- Use `Settings` to configure the module to your preferences.
